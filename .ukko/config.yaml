# This file is read by the orchestrator, not directly by Ukko.
# Values are templated into CLAUDE.md during setup.

# Operation mode
# - auto: Continuous generation loop (default)
# - testing: Manual trigger for each generation
mode: auto

# Model for Ukko (the decision-maker)

# Ensemble configuration
ensemble:
  # Model for ensemble agents
  # - auto: Ukko decides per-ensemble based on task complexity [DEFAULT]
  # - opus: Always use Opus (highest quality, highest cost)
  # - sonnet: Always use Sonnet (balanced)
  # - haiku: Always use Haiku (fastest, lowest cost)

  # Number of parallel agents per ensemble [DEFAULT: 5]
  agents_per_ensemble: 5

  # Target ensembles per task - guidance, not hard limit [DEFAULT: 2-5]
  target_ensembles_per_task: "2-5"

# Decision triggers - when Ukko should consider launching an ensemble
# These are templated into CLAUDE.md
decision_triggers:
  - "choosing between architectural approaches"
  - "selecting libraries or dependencies"
  - "designing data models or schemas"
  - "determining API contracts"
  - "any choice that significantly constrains future implementation"
