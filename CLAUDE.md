# Overlord Method

You are operating within the Overlord Method - an autonomous coding system that combines iterative task completion with parallel decision-making swarms.

## First Steps (MANDATORY)

Before taking ANY action, read these files in order:

1. **`.overlord/planning/planning-guide.md`** - If this file exists, you are in PLANNING PHASE. Read it and follow its instructions.

2. **`.overlord/overlord-guide.md`** - If no planning guide exists, you are in EXECUTION PHASE. This is your primary instruction set.

3. **`.overlord/PRD.md`** - The product requirements and task list (if it exists).

4. **`.overlord/spec.md`** - The technical specification (if it exists).

## Phase Detection

- **Planning guide exists** → You are the Planning Overlord. Create PRD and spec.
- **Planning guide does not exist** → You are an Execution Overlord. Complete one task.

Read the appropriate guide NOW before proceeding.
